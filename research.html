          Primary Research
        </h1>
        <p>
          After interviewing 82 undergraduate college students from Indiana University, we found that 67 of them or 81.7% prefer receiving text messages alerting them of their rewards. The rewards Sandwichr sends out will be a marketing program designed to give its customers the ability to receive promotional items such as free sandwiches, chips, and drinks. Sandwichr will design a web application for online ordering and will be garnered towards the customer’s preference. If they decided to receive text-messages or email notifications, it only takes a change of settings in their user profile.

          Secondary Research: POS System
        </h1>
        <p>
          We find that today most restaurants incorporate a POS system, also called Point of Sale (Whitteker). POS systems are usually docked through the cloud or web and use touch screen monitors throughout the restaurant for convenience of the workers. <q>This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow, food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously</q> (Mealey). Another extraordinary benefit of using a POS system is payroll, which allows employees to clock-in and clock-out, sending information to the cloud and web to generate checks for the workers. Using pen &amp; paper or even a cash register doesn’t get the job done, especially when customers desire to swipe their card. A POS system on the other hand “tracks every penny of your sales, [making] many POS programs also act as credit card processors” (Mealey). Not only does it track sales, but a POS system can make the accounting process much easier. <q>Old fashioned cash registers force accountants to sort through hundreds of receipts, but with a point of sale system financial personnel can simply use the built in reports or create their own</q>(Greenhaw).
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>Another benefit of a POS system is that it simplifies communications between the kitchen and the wait staff</q> (Mealey). Typically when an order is passed through at the main POS monitor, the order is sent back to the kitchen in chronological order, making the kitchen staff rely on the technology instead of passing written checks to the back. The check is printed and can be stapled to the order. Seeing all the pros in using a POS system can only leave someone asking what is a disadvantage to using this kind of technology? Restaurants in the past have experienced data lossage when their systems have crashed and many, during peak business hours, have had to call tech support to reboot the system. This can lead to loss in customers, payroll tracking, and profit and loss data.

          These insights from this research has given us several aspects about the importance of a POS system, a technological advancement every busy business needs. Sandwichr will implement one because it is gaining popularity in Bloomington and will need a POS system to manage orders, deliveries, generate payroll, and offer profit and loss statements to the manager. When ordering online, the POS system collects the user’s email and phone number which can be used to send a survey, asking customers how they would like to receive their rewards.
