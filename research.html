          Primary Research
        </h1>
        <p>
          After interviewing 82 undergraduate college students from Indiana University, we found that 67 of them or 81.7% prefer receiving text messages alerting them of their rewards. The rewards Sandwichr sends out will be a marketing program designed to give its customers the ability to receive promotional items such as free sandwiches, chips, and drinks. Sandwichr will design a web application for online ordering and will be garnered towards the customer’s preference. If they decided to receive text-messages or email notifications, it only takes a change of settings in their user profile. Below is a database with tables referencing our groups preferences of either email, text, or both.

          Secondary Research: POS System, Social Media, Online Delivery
        </h1>
        <p>
          We find that today most restaurants incorporate a POS system, also called Point of Sale (Whitteker). POS systems are usually docked through the cloud or web and use touch screen monitors throughout the restaurant for convenience of the workers. <q>This computerized system allows business owners to track sales, cash flow, food inventory and can help simplify your bookkeeping enormously</q> (Mealey). Another extraordinary benefit of using a POS system is payroll, which allows employees to clock-in and clock-out, sending information to the cloud and web to generate checks for the workers. Using pen &amp; paper or even a cash register doesn’t get the job done, especially when customers desire to swipe their card. A POS system on the other hand “tracks every penny of your sales, [making] many POS programs also act as credit card processors” (Mealey). Not only does it track sales, but a POS system can make the accounting process much easier. <q>Old fashioned cash registers force accountants to sort through hundreds of receipts, but with a point of sale system financial personnel can simply use the built in reports or create their own</q>(Greenhaw).
        </p>
        <p>
          <q>Another benefit of a POS system is that it simplifies communications between the kitchen and the wait staff</q> (Mealey). Typically when an order is passed through at the main POS monitor, the order is sent back to the kitchen in chronological order, making the kitchen staff rely on the technology instead of passing written checks to the back. The check is printed and can be stapled to the order. Seeing all the pros in using a POS system can only leave someone asking what is a disadvantage to using this kind of technology? Restaurants in the past have experienced data lossage when their systems have crashed and many, during peak business hours, have had to call tech support to reboot the system. This can lead to loss in customers, payroll tracking, and profit and loss data. POS systems can have up to 190000 lines of Java code, and when tracking the error (Berner), it could take some time.
        </p>
        <h1 class="body-h1">Secondary Research: Social Media</h1>
        <p>
          <q>Four out of every five corporations in America are now leveraging social media to help expand their client base and build relationships with customers,</q> (Patel). In today’s day and age, customers live through their phones and their social media. It is essential to be involved in some type of social media to have a successful and thriving business nowadays. For a small business like Sandwichr, we will be using a variety of social media accounts to not only gain new customers, but to keep our old ones as well. By using social media apps like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat, we will be able to promote our brand throughout Bloomington and  perhaps throughout all of Indiana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using so many different apps to promote a business can be time consuming and distracting from normal business obligations. Using a social media management program app like Hootsuite or Buffer make it easier for a business owner because it allows them to manage multiple social media apps at once (Patel). It is important to learn everything about these tools because it will allow a business owner to master social media to promote their business. One useful tool that has been created is automating. This allows someone to automatically retweet messages on Twitter, following people back, respond to direct messages, post content, and more without the repetitiveness and time of doing it one at a time (Patel). However one should “strive to automate while keeping things personal,” meaning that real engagement with an owner’s customers is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s one thing to have a social media account, but another to keep customers interested and coming back for more. <q>Free stuff, being famous, and being right,</q> are three ways to make an account follow-worthy (Patel). Making an account interactive is the best way to promote a business. By hosting contests, giveaways, and posting top follower photos for everybody to see, the owner of a small business can create a buzz about his/her business that others will want to join in on (Patel). It is also important to remember that consistency is key. Using social media allows a business to show its personality and being consistent allows one to build a “cohesive and representative” brand identity (Nethercott). By keeping consistent messages, visuals, fonts, timing, colors, and more, the business can show customers it’s personal identity and make it standout from the rest (Nethercott). 
        </p>
        <h1 class="body-h1">Secondary Research: Online Ordering &amp; Delivery</h1>
        <p>
          <q>Two types of online platforms have risen to fill that void. The first type is the <q>aggregators,</q> which emerged roughly 15 years ago; the second is the <q>new delivery<q> players, which appeared in 2013</q> (Carsten). Aggregators are basically a mix between delivery and takeout.  They provide the customer with menus to compare, prices, ratings, and several other different types of important information in order for them to make a well informed decision on what type of food they are ordering. They are then able to place an order online through a website that holds information on several different restaurants and redirects them to the restaurant’s page to complete the order. From there the restaurant handles the delivery serivce themselves with their own delivery people.  New delivery players are different in that they do not send the customer to deal with the restaurant directly, the orders are placed on the large delivery website and then that website’s delivery people go to pick up the customer’s food from the restaurant and then deliver it to the customer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There is potential for restaurants that use their own delivery systems to switch to one of these two types of online ordering platforms, finding it to be more cost efficient. This is more true for the new delivery type of platform because it eliminates the need for restaurants to hire and continue to pay their own delivery workers. This poses threats to both delivery jobs at restaurants and to the aggregator platforms as a whole. New delivery is also gaining in popularity because it is a way to still eat a nice meal at home, but not have to cook, or even go pick up the food. All that is needed is for the customer to place an order, with the click of just a few buttons, and wait for it to be delivered right to their door. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Customer behavior shows that the use of these platforms are working well. While it proves that once a customer uses one of these platforms they rarely leave for a different one, it also shows that most of the orders are placed from home instead of at work. The statistics show that the most important part for these platforms is timing. The time it takes for the food to be delivered is carefully watched by customers because they want to make sure they are getting their food as fast as possible. Any more than a 60 minute wait is something that could make a customer switch to a different platform (Carsten). The article also shows that 74 percent of the orders placed on these platforms are placed on the weekends (Carsten). This stresses the fact that it is in high demand for people trying to enjoy a nice dinner at home while still enjoying stress free time before eating, meaning they do not have to cook or really clean much after their meal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With all the statistics and information pointing at online ordering platforms, we should expect it to become the norm in the future. Due to the fact that it makes things easier on both the customer and the restaurant it is only a matter of time until platforms take over the ordering and delivery process completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          These insights from this research has given us several aspects about the importance of a POS system, social media, and a delivery system, all technological advancements every busy business needs. Sandwichr will implement one because it is gaining popularity in Bloomington and will need a POS system to manage orders, deliveries, generate payroll, and offer profit and loss statements to the manager. When ordering online, the POS system collects the user’s email and phone number which can be used to send a survey, asking customers how they would like to receive their rewards.
